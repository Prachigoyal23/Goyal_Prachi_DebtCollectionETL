# Borrowers Insights

Overview

In this assignment, I conducted a detailed analysis of data retrieved from a Google Drive link using Python libraries such as pandas and gdown. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process:

    Data Extraction: Initially, I utilized gdown to download the dataset from the provided Google Drive link directly to my local machine. Once downloaded, pandas was employed to structure and prepare the data for analysis.

    Data Analysis: Using SQL, I performed an insightful analysis on the dataset. This involved querying and summarizing relevant information to derive meaningful insights.

Code and Results

    Python Code: The Python script used for data extraction can be found etl_script.py.

    SQL Code: The SQL queries for data analysis are available analysis_queries.sql.

    Interpretation and Results: The interpretation of the analysis and its results are detailed in analysis_results.txt document/report.

Conclusion

This assignment not only demonstrated my proficiency in data handling with Python and SQL but also showcased my ability to derive actionable insights from raw data
